# BuddyMoving Roadmap

## Near-term plan (next 2–4 weeks)

- Polish onboarding and empty states for first-time users.
- Add request history (latest 5–10 analyses) stored in local storage.
- Improve AI resilience: retries, clearer fallback messaging, and latency badges.
- Add basic analytics to track task volume and completion rates.

## Key hypotheses & success metrics

- **Hypothesis:** structured AI output speeds up early product discovery.
  - **Metric:** median time-to-first-action < 3 minutes.
- **Hypothesis:** clarity of analysis drives repeat use.
  - **Metric:** 7‑day return rate > 25%.
- **Hypothesis:** teams value shareable output.
  - **Metric:** ≥ 20% of sessions export or copy results.

## Potential product directions

- Team workspaces with shared libraries of tasks and insights.
- Templates for common product workflows (onboarding, pricing, growth loops).
- Integrations with docs/PM tools (Notion, Linear, Jira).
